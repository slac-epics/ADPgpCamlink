# Genicam Serial Protocol
#
# This file is used for cameras with the GenCP protocol, a binary protocol.
# By selecting GenCP via a cfg file parameter, we enable wrapper
# functions which translate simple ASCII serial commands which are
# compatible w/ streamdevice to the proper GenCP packets including
# checksums and packet IDs.
#
# The raw GenCP protocol just does memory read/write.
# This ASCII protocol supports read and write memory commands for different types.
#
# Line terminator for send and receive is CR.
#
# First character is the type, followed by a count.
# For scalars, the count is the number of bits.
# For arrays, it's the number of elements:
#	U8	8  bit unsigned integer
#	U16	16 bit unsigned integer
#	U32	32 bit unsigned integer
#	U64	32 bit unsigned integer
#	I8	8  bit signed integer
#	I16	16 bit signed integer
#	I16	16 bit signed integer
#	I16	16 bit signed integer
#	F32	32 bit floating point, float
#	F64	64 bit floating point, double
#	C8	8  byte character string
#	C64	64 byte character string
#	B8	8  byte byte array as space separated 2 digit hex values
#	B20	20 byte byte array as space separated 2 digit hex values
#
# This is followed by whitespace, then a register address,
# then = for assignment or ? for read.
#
# Acknowledge packets are also binary and translated as follows:
#
# Error packet, ERR followed by whitespace then the error code
# ERR 8001
#
# Success packet, OK, followed for query ack w/ whitespace then the register value.
#
# Examples:
# Read 64 bit unsigned int at register 0x130F4
# U64 0x1D0?
# OK 0x00013108
#
# Write -2.5 to 32 bit float at register 0x130F4
# F32 0x130F4=-2.5
# OK
#
# TODO: Add bit field support?  U32.2.14 could be bits 14 and 15 of 32 bit word
#
# This gives us simple access to low level camera registers.
# Accessing the camera via the features defined in it's feature XML file
# requires use of the genicam software api.
#
# Some key register addresses, lengths, and names:
# Address		Length	Name
# 0x00000000	U32		GenCP Version
# 0x00000004	C64		64 character Manufacturer Name
# 0x00000044	C64		64 character Model Name
# 0x000001D0	U64		Manifest table address (XML feature files)
# 0x000001E0	U64		Device Configuration: Bit 0=HeartbeatEnable, Bit1=MultiEventEnable
# 0x000001E8	U32		Heartbeat Timeout in ms
# 0x00000204	U32		AccessPrivilege, 0=Avail (no image streaming), 1=Exclusive
# NOTE: Must set AccessPrivilege in BRM to 1 for write access and read or write at
# least once every 3 sec so heartbeat won't timeout and stop image streaming!
#
# Address		Length	Name
# 0x000130F4	U32		RegAcquisitionStart, 0=Stop, 1=Start
# 0x00013108	U32		RegAcquisitionMode, 1=Continuous, 2=Single, 3=Multiple
# 0x00013108	U32		RegAcquisitionFrameCount, used for Multiple AcquisitionMode
#
# Manifest Table
# Offset		Length	Name
# 0             8       Number of entries
# 8             64		Entry 0
# 8+1*64        64		Entry 1
# ...
# 8+N*64        64		Entry N
#
# Manifest Entry, one per GeniCam XML file
# Offset		Length	Name
# 0             4       FileVersion
# 4             4       Schema (version and compressed flag)
# 8             8       Start register of file
# 16            8		File Size
# 24            20		SHA1-Hash
